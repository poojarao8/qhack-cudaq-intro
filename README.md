Here is the suggested order for using the notebooks, but feel free to switch it up as per your background and interest.

1. [cudaq_introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/poojarao8/qhack-cudaq-intro/blob/master/cudaq_introduction.ipynb)

2. [cudaq_targets.ipynb](https://github.com/poojarao8/qhack-cudaq-intro/blob/master/cudaq_targets.ipynb)
    (Some code snippets are designed to run optimally with multiple GPUs, but they will revert to using a single GPU if only one is available.)

3. [hybrid_qnns.ipynb](https://github.com/poojarao8/qhack-cudaq-intro/blob/master/hybrid_qnns.ipynb)
